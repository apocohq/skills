# Roadmap

## Context & Persona

- [ ] Ground the skill in projects, not just a flat list of todos
- [ ] Add a lightweight personal "persona" (what I care about, what I'm optimizing for)
- [ ] Build a basic foundation of work context
- [ ] Figure out how to bring the right context (company reality, personal voice and priorities) and keep it current without making it brittle
- [ ] Handle company vs. personal context separation

## Integrations

- [ ] Integrate with external systems (calendar, docs, CRM) without leaking or hallucinating
- [ ] Tighter loop with Granola: when a meeting ends and action items pop out, route them into Things with the right tags and deadlines (with me in control, not fully automatic)
- [ ] Support pasting a transcript or messy notes, ask "pull out the todos", then review before anything lands

## Automation

- [ ] Run automatically every morning (cron job or scheduled task) so it becomes a routine
- [ ] Safe by default: read-only where possible, clear guardrails, and a review step so it can't go rogue

## Configuration

- [ ] More granular knobs so I can change how it categorizes without touching code

## Prioritization & Delegation

- [ ] Get sharper about delegation and dropping work
- [ ] Apply the Drucker question: "What can only I do?"
